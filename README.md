# Side-Projects for interests in Vision
## Hope to build this out more and more as I learn more about Computer Vision

# Project: Canny Edge Detector
### implementation of the canny edge detection algorithm to detect edges within an image
### using for research in identifying firing cells in a brain
### to run sample code, simply download the code (and the image file) and run "python canny_edge_detector.py" in the command line

# Sub-Project: Hough Transform method
### implementation of Hough Transform method for transforming an image into Hough space and finding accumulator cells for detecting lines in an image
